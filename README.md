## Configuration

To install the necessary libraries, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: To minimize the number of libraries installed, each demo folder has its own `requirements.txt` file with specific dependencies.

Please create an `.env` file with the same structure as the provided `.env.example` files (found in each demo folder), and enter your personal API keys and endpoints therein.

## Use

Run the Python script from the terminal (or your IDE).

For more detailed information, open the README files in the respective demo folders.

### Gradio

For [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast) projects, this will print a **URL** to the console. Surf to the generated address in your browser to use the Gradio web UI.

The default URL is http://127.0.0.1:7860, which runs locally. If the address is specified to `0.0.0.0`, it will also be available to other computers on your network, using your IP address. To create a publicly accessible link, set `share=True` in the Gradio `launch()` call.
